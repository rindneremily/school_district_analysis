# Overview of the school district analysis
This analysis was designed to take multiple pieces of data and evaluate them based on the specifications. It taught me how to focus on specific aspects of a whole chart while using supplemental data to come to conclusions. It also gave more exposure to anaconda and jupyter suntax. This text editor is different from what has been used in past data analyses.
# Results
## District Summary
The district summary was affected the most by specifying the type of school we were looking to analyze. The district data frame held valuable data regarding budgets and school types. But it was difficult to compare this data frame with others. We decided to merge the data frames in order to get a clearer view on what we were hoping to examine. The merging also let us manipulate the data as a whole rather than in two separate pieces.
## School Summary
The school summary was affected the most when we were manipulating the grade and school name. These manipulations cut the amount of data in half or even less. This data frame alone provided a great amount of data but the merging made it much more clear what type of data I was looking at. 
## Replacements
Their performance was changed but not as drastically as expected. Generally, the averages change between school districts pretty minimally unless the area and resources are completely different. There are always extrapulations in data that will affect the averages seen.
* Math and reading scores only differed slightly. Mostly increases.
# Summary
A major change was the averages for the school entirely. The 9th grade held a large portion of the data and taking them away affected the averages.
